## About

In this competition, we built a classification model using CatBoost. Using over 350 variables, we attempt to build a model for predicting vaccination status on a holdout dataset of 525,158 observations using a training dataset of 974,842 obsrvations.

The model prediction results, evaluated by AUC, ranked **2/75** in the competition round 1 leaderboard.
