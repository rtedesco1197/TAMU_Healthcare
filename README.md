TAMU Competition Collab

In this competition, we built a classification model using CatBoost. Using over 350 variables, we attempt to predict vaccination status using a holdout set of 750,000 obsrvations and a test set of 250,000 observations. 

The model prediction results, evaluated by AUC, ranked **2/75** in the competition round 1 leaderboard.
