# TAMU_Healthcare
TAMU Competition Collab

In this competition, we built a classification model using Catboost. Using over 350 variables, we attempt to predict vaccination status using a holdout set of 750,000 obsrvations and a test set of 250,000 observations. 


This model ranked as the second best model (defined by AUC) in the competition out of about 75 teams.
