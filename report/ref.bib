  abstract = {Tree boosting is a highly effective and widely used machine learning method. In this
    paper, we describe a scalable end-to-end tree boosting system called XGBoost, which
    is used widely by data scientists to achieve state-of-the-art results on many machine
    learning challenges. We propose a novel sparsity-aware algorithm for sparse data and
    weighted quantile sketch for approximate tree learning. More importantly, we provide
    insights on cache access patterns, data compression and sharding to build a scalable
    tree boosting system. By combining these insights, XGBoost scales beyond billions
    of examples using far fewer resources than existing systems.},

title = {CatBoost: Unbiased Boosting with Categorical Features},
year = {2018},
publisher = {Curran Associates Inc.},
address = {Red Hook, NY, USA},
abstract = {This paper presents the key algorithmic techniques behind CatBoost, a new gradient
boosting toolkit. Their combination leads to CatBoost outperforming other publicly
available boosting implementations in terms of quality on a variety of datasets. Two
critical algorithmic advances introduced in CatBoost are the implementation of ordered
boosting, a permutation-driven alternative to the classic algorithm, and an innovative
algorithm for processing categorical features. Both techniques were created to fight
a prediction shift caused by a special kind of target leakage present in all currently
existing implementations of gradient boosting algorithms. In this paper, we provide
a detailed analysis of this problem and demonstrate that proposed algorithms solve
it effectively, leading to excellent empirical results.},
